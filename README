Checkbot -- a WWW link verifier

Checkbot is a perl5 script which can verify links within a region of
the World Wide Web. It checks all pages within an identified region,
and all links within that region. After checking all links within the
region, it will also check all links which point outside of the
region, and then stop.

Checkbot regularly writes reports on its findings, including all
servers found in the region, and all links with problems on those
servers.

Checkbot was written originally to check a number of servers at
once. This has implied some design decisions, so you might want to
keep that in mind when making suggestions. Speaking of which, be sure
to check the to do file on the website for things which have been
suggested for Checkbot.

RECENT CHANGES

Changes in version 1.79 (3-Feb-2007)

    * Correctly parse documents to avoid problems with UTF-8
      documents. This avoids the "Parsing of undecoded UTF-8 will give
      garbage when decoding entities" messages.
    * Allow regular expressions in the suppression file, and complain if
      the suppression file is not a proper file.
    * More robust handling of HTTP and FTP servers that have problems
      responding to HEAD requests.
    * Use the original URL to report problems.
    * Ensure XHTML compliance.

Changes in version 1.78 (3-May-2006)

    * Don't throw errors for links that cannot be expected to be valid
      all the time (e.g. the classid attribute of an object element)
    * Better fallbacks for some cases where the HEAD request does not
      work
    * Add more classes and ids to allow more styling of results pages
      (including example CSS file)
    * Ensure XHTML compliance
    * Better checks for optional dependencies

Changes in version 1.77 (28-Jul-2005)

    * Fix silly build-related problem that prevented checkbot 1.76 from
      running at all.
    * Check for presence of robots meta tag and act on it.

Changes in version 1.76 (25-Jul-2005)

    * Error reports now include the page title for easier identification.
    * javascript: links are now ignored because they cannot be checked.
    * Documentation updates.

Changes in version 1.75 (22-Apr-2004)

    * New --cookies option to accept cookies from servers while checking.
    * New --noproxy option indicates which domains should not be
      passed through the proxy.

      schemes are ignored now.
    * Minor bug fixes.
    * Documentation updates.

Changes in version 1.74 (17-Dec-2003)

    * New --suppress option allows Response code/URL combinations not
      to be reported as problems.
    * Checkbot warnings are now handled as pseudo-HTTP status messages
      so that they can make use of all Checkbot features such as
      --dontwarn.
    * Option --allow-simple-hosts is deprecated due to this change.
    * More robust handling of (lack of) status messages.
    * Checkbot now requires LWP 5.70 due to bugfixes in this release,
      although it should still also work with older LWP versions.
    * Documentation fixes.

Changes in version 1.73 (31-Aug-2003)

    * Checkbot now tries to produce valid XHTML 1.1
    * URLs matching the --ignore option are now completely ignored;
      they used to be checked but not reported.
    * Proxy support works again, but --proxy now applies to all links
    * Documentation fixes

Changes in version 1.72 (04-May-2003)

    * URLs with query strings are now checked by default, the
      --exclude option can be used to revert to the previous behavior

    * Removed warning for unqualified hostnames for news: URLs
    * Handling of signals such as SIGINT
    * Bug and documentation fixes

Changes in version 1.71 (29-Dec-2002)

    * New --filter option allows rewriting of URLs before they will be checked
    * Problematic links are now reported for each page on which they occur
    * New statistics which should work correctly
    * Much simplified storage of information on problem links

    * Rewritten internals for link checking, as a consequence internal
      and external links are checked at the same time now, not in two
      passes like before
    * Rewritten internals for message output
    * A simple test case for 'make test'
    * Minor cleanups of the code
